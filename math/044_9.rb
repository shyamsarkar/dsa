# 9. Palindrome Number

=begin
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

  return false if x < 0 || (x != 0 && x % 10 == 0)

  reverse = 0

  while x > reverse
    reverse = reverse * 10 + x % 10
    x /= 10
  end

  x == reverse || x == reverse/10
