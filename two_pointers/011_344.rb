#344. Reverse String

=begin
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

# @param {Character[]} s
# @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
def reverse_string(s)
    left = 0
    right = s.length - 1

    while left < right
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    end
end
