# 860. Lemonade Change

=begin
At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
Example 2:

Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.

Constraints:

1 <= bills.length <= 105
bills[i] is either 5, 10, or 20.

# My Solution

# @param {Integer[]} bills
# @return {Boolean}
def lemonade_change(bills)
  count = Hash.new(0)

  bills.each do |bill|
    count[bill] += 1
    remaining = bill

    if remaining >= 20 && count[10] > 0
        count[10] -= 1
        remaining -= 10
    end

    required_fives = (remaining - 5) / 5

    return false if required_fives > count[5]
    
    count[5] -= required_fives
  end

  true
end

# Actual Solution


# @param {Integer[]} bills
# @return {Boolean}
def lemonade_change(bills)
  five = 0
  ten = 0

  bills.each do |bill|
    if bill == 5
      five += 1
    elsif bill == 10
      return false if five == 0

      five -= 1
      ten += 1
    elsif bill == 20
      if ten > 0 && five > 0
          ten -= 1
          five -= 1
      elsif five >= 3
          five -= 3
      else
        return false
      end
    end
  end

  true
